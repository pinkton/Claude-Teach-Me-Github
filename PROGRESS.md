## Current Session: 2026-01-08

### Session Focus
- Continued pointers — array/pointer relationship
- Identified mental model shift needed (high-level vs low-level thinking)

### What Was Completed Today

**1. Pointer Fundamentals - VERIFIED**
- Confirmed dereference operator works: `*ptr` outputs `42`
- Full output verified:
  ```
  Value of num: 42
  Address of num: 0x7ffd08750ca4
  Value stored in ptr: 0x7ffd08750ca4
  Value pointed to by ptr: 42
  ```

**2. Arrays ARE Pointers - COMPLETED**
- Proved `scores` and `&scores[0]` output identical addresses
- Array name by itself is the address of the first element

**3. Array Indexing is Pointer Arithmetic - COMPLETED**
- Proved `scores[2]` and `*(scores + 2)` both output `30`
- Bracket notation is syntactic sugar for pointer arithmetic + dereference
- `scores[i]` is equivalent to `*(scores + i)`

**4. Address Spacing Observation - COMPLETED**
- Displayed addresses of `scores[0]`, `scores[1]`, `scores[2]`
- Observed 4-byte increments (sizeof int)
- Pointer arithmetic scales by `sizeof(type)`, not by 1 byte

**5. Mental Model Gap Identified - CRITICAL**
- User has years of high-level thinking: "array[i] points to a value"
- Low-level reality: "array[i] dereferences an address"
- This is backwards from intuition and requires active reinforcement
- Added varied test questions to CLAUDE.md for future sessions

### Current Code State

**File:** `practice/cpp/pointers/pointers.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    // int* ptr - declares a pointer (part of the type)
    // *ptr - dereferences a pointer (accesses the value)
    int* ptr = &num;

    std::cout << "Value of num: " << num << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Address of num: " << &num << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value stored in ptr: " << ptr << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Value pointed to by ptr: " << *ptr << std::endl;

    // Arrays and pointers relationship
    int scores[5] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

    std::cout << "\n--- Arrays ARE Pointers ---" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "scores (array name): " << scores << std::endl;
    std::cout << "&scores[0] (address of first element): " << &scores[0] << std::endl;

    std::cout << "\n--- Array Indexing is Pointer Arithmetic ---" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "scores[2]: " << scores[2] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "*(scores + 2): " << *(scores + 2) << std::endl;

    std::cout << "\n--- Watch the Addresses ---" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Address of scores[0]: " << &scores[0] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Address of scores[1]: " << &scores[1] << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Address of scores[2]: " << &scores[2] << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

### Where We Left Off

User understands the concepts intellectually but identified that the mental model needs reinforcement through practice. The high-level abstraction of "pointing to a value" is deeply ingrained and needs to be replaced with the low-level reality of "dereferencing an address."

**Next action:** Practice exercises to reinforce the pointer/array mental model

### Next Session Plan

1. **Warm-up questions** - Test the pointer concepts (see questions below)
2. **Iterate array with pointer** - Use pointer arithmetic instead of index to traverse array
3. **Modify values through pointers** - Show `*ptr = 100` changes the original variable
4. **Two-way equivalence practice** - Convert between `array[i]` and `*(array + i)` notation

### Knowledge to Test Next Session

**Must ask these to reinforce mental model shift:**

Basic recall:
- "What does `&variable` give you?" (the memory address)
- "What does `*pointer` give you?" (the value at that address)

Syntax distinction:
- "What's the difference between `int* ptr` and `*ptr`?" (declaration vs dereferencing)

The critical insight (ask multiple ways):
- "What does `scores[2]` actually do under the hood?" (pointer arithmetic + dereference)
- "Is `scores[2]` a pointer or a value?" (a value — it's already dereferenced)
- "Rewrite `scores[3]` using pointer syntax." (`*(scores + 3)`)
- "Rewrite `*(ptr + 1)` using array syntax." (`ptr[1]`)

Address arithmetic:
- "Why does `scores + 1` add 4 bytes, not 1 byte?" (scales by sizeof(type))
- "If `scores` is at `0x1000`, what's the address of `scores[2]`?" (0x1008)

Equivalence:
- "Are `scores` and `&scores[0]` the same?" (yes — both address of first element)

## Previous Session: 2026-01-07

### Session Focus
- Completed `sizeof` operator for arrays
- Created bash workflow shortcuts
- Started pointers (address-of and dereference operators)

### What Was Completed

**1. sizeof Operator - COMPLETED**
- Learnt `sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0])` for dynamic array length calculation
- Understood why `sizeof(array[0])` is better than `sizeof(type)` (maintainability)
- Tested with different array sizes and types (`int` vs `char`)
- Proved that dynamic sizing adapts automatically when array size changes

**2. Bash Shortcuts - COMPLETED**
- Created `compile-asm` function in `~/.bashrc`
  - Compiles C++ to executable and Intel-syntax assembly in one command
  - Usage: `compile-asm filename.cpp`
- Created `gitpush` function in `~/.bashrc`
  - Stages, commits, and pushes to main in one command
  - Usage: `gitpush "commit message"`
- Documented both shortcuts in README.md and CLAUDE.md

**3. Pointers Started - PARTIAL**
- Created `practice/cpp/pointers/` directory and `pointers.cpp`
- Learnt address-of operator (`&`) - gets memory address of variable
- Learnt pointer declaration syntax (`int* ptr = &num`)
- Observed ASLR in action (addresses change each run)

## Recent Milestones

### Loops - COMPLETED (Previous Sessions)

### Functions - COMPLETED (Previous Sessions)

- ✓ GitHub authentication (Personal Access Token)
- ✓ Handling divergent branches
- ✓ Understanding when to use full workflow vs pragmatic commits

## Current Learning Phase

**Phase:** C/C++ Development (Phase 2 of 5)

**Immediate Goals:**
- [ ] Reinforce pointer/array mental model through varied exercises
- [ ] Pointer arithmetic iteration (traverse array with pointer, not index)
- [ ] Modify values through pointers
- [ ] Different data types (char, float, string, bool)
- [ ] Memory management (heap vs stack from developer perspective)

**Concept Requiring Active Reinforcement:**
The relationship between arrays and pointers, specifically that `array[i]` is syntactic sugar for `*(array + i)`. User's high-level mental model ("pointing to a value") needs to be replaced with low-level understanding ("dereferencing an address"). This will be tested at the start of each session until it becomes automatic.

**Next Phase:** Windows Internals & DLL Development
