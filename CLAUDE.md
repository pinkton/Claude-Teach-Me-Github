# Claude Context File

## Project: Game Modding Tools Development

## IMPORTANT: Language Preference
**Please use British English in all responses:**
- British spelling (colour, organisation, realise, whilst, etc.)
- British terminology and conventions
- Metric units where applicable

## Public Repository Notice
This repository is **publicly accessible** on GitHub at: https://github.com/pinkton/Claude-Teach-Me
- Do not include sensitive information
- User is learning and documenting the process publicly
- AI-generated files are prefixed with `AI-*` to distinguish from user-created work
- Work created then updated is a grey area, but user understands that they create their own files first, then get Claude to provide context and provide rewording based on pre-existing user created content, opposed to halucinating from nothingness.

## Project Purpose
This is a **learning repository** for developing C/C++ skills to create game modification tools, specifically targeting legacy games that struggle on modern operating systems or have abandoned features.
Every training session is to be it's own folder to some degree, allowing public visibility into what has/hasn't been achieved, and they can see an element of notes/examples for revision at later dates. 

**Current Target:** [This Means Warp](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1269300/This_Means_Warp/) - Roguelike space game with an unreliable multiplayer save system.

**Ultimate Goal:** Create DLL injection tools and game logic modifications to implement a reliable save system.

## User Background - IMPORTANT

**Existing Skills:**
- **GIAC GREM certified** - Professional reverse engineering of malware
- **Reverse engineering tools:** Ghidra, IDA Pro, x64dbg (experienced)
- **CTF experience** - Capture The Flag challenges (Multiple years of simple challenges, but foundational knowledge intact)
- **Binary analysis:** Comfortable reading assembly, understanding PE format, tracing execution
- **Scripting:** Python and PowerShell (day job usage)
- **Conceptual understanding:** Variables, loops, functions, control flow (high-level concepts)

**The Gap - What User NEEDS to Learn:**
- **C/C++ syntax and development** - Can read assembly, but can't write C/C++ code
- **Building executables and DLLs** - Need to understand toolchains, compilers, linkers
- **Game reverse engineering methodology** - Different from malware analysis:
  - Malware RE: "Look for malicious patterns" (threat hunting)
  - Game RE: "Look for functional patterns" (feature hunting)
  - Need to find UI code, save systems, game logic (not IOCs or suspicious APIs)
- **Creating user-facing tools** - Not just analysis, but building tools others can use
- **Memory management from developer perspective** - Allocating and manipulating, not just analysing

**Critical Insight:**
User can **analyse** code but needs to learn to **write** code. Shift from "reverse engineering analyst" to "game modding developer."

## Learning Path (Updated)

**Learning Path (in order):**
1. **Git Workflow** - COMPLETED
2. **C/C++ Development** - IN PROGRESS (current focus)
3. **Windows Internals & DLL Development** - UPCOMING (transferable to any Windows application)
4. **Game RE Fundamentals** - UPCOMING (practice on UT99 as training target)
5. **Building the This Means Warp Mod** - FUTURE (ultimate goal, subject to change)

### 1. Git Workflow - COMPLETED
- [x] Repository setup and configuration
- [x] Branch workflow (feature → develop → main)
- [x] Creating and switching branches
- [x] Committing changes with meaningful messages
- [x] Merging feature branches through develop to main
- [x] Pushing to GitHub with authentication (Personal Access Token)
- [x] Handling divergent branches with git pull
- [x] Understanding when to use proper workflow vs direct commits
- [x] Multi-machine authentication setup

### 2. C/C++ Development - IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Learn to write C/C++ code, not just read assembly.

- [x] Development environment setup (gcc, g++, make already installed in WSL2)
- [x] First Hello World program (`practice/cpp/hello-world/helloworld.cpp`)
- [x] Compilation process understanding (preprocessing, compiling, assembly, linking)
- [x] Compiling to Intel-syntax assembly (`g++ -S -masm=intel`) for analysis
- [x] Functions with parameters and return values (`practice/cpp/add-two-numbers/add-two-numbers.cpp`)
- [x] Understanding x86-64 calling conventions (EDI, ESI for params; EAX for return)
- [x] User input with `std::cin >>`
- [x] If/else statements and conditional logic (`practice/cpp/if-number-loop/if-greater-smaller.cpp`)
- [x] Key bug discovered: `=` (assignment) vs `==` (comparison) - caught and fixed
- [x] Loops - all three types mastered:
  - [x] `while` loops - condition checked first (`practice/cpp/if-number-loop/if-greater-smaller.cpp`)
  - [x] `do-while` loops - condition checked after, guaranteed one execution (`practice/cpp/do-while-loop/do-while-loop.cpp`)
  - [x] `for` loops - best for counting/iteration with init, condition, update (`practice/cpp/for-loop/for-loop.cpp`)
- [x] Loop control - `break` to exit, `continue` to skip to next iteration
- [x] Input validation - `std::cin.fail()` to detect errors, `std::cin.clear()` to reset, `std::cin.ignore()` to flush buffer
- [x] String concatenation in output - chaining `<<` operators instead of `+` for mixed types
- [x] Arrays - fundamentals completed (`practice/cpp/arrays/arrays.cpp`):
  - [x] Declaration and initialisation (`int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}`)
  - [x] Zero-based indexing - valid indices 0 to N-1
  - [x] Memory layout - contiguous blocks, 4-byte spacing for int arrays
  - [x] Iteration with for loops
  - [x] Out-of-bounds access and undefined behaviour - intentionally triggered to see garbage stack values
  - [x] sizeof operator for calculating array length
- [x] Pointers - fundamentals (`practice/cpp/pointers/pointers.cpp`):
  - [x] Address-of operator (`&`) - gets memory address of variable
  - [x] Pointer declaration (`int* ptr = &num`)
  - [x] Dereference operator (`*ptr`) - accesses value at address
  - [x] ASLR observation - addresses change each run
  - [x] Arrays ARE pointers - `scores` and `&scores[0]` are identical
  - [x] Array indexing is pointer arithmetic - `scores[2]` equals `*(scores + 2)`
  - [x] Memory address spacing - addresses increase by `sizeof(type)` bytes
- [ ] Pointer arithmetic practice - iterating arrays with pointers instead of indices
- [ ] Memory management (heap vs stack from developer perspective)
- [ ] Creating DLLs and understanding linking
- [ ] Build systems (Makefiles, CMake, or similar)
- [ ] Debugging C/C++ code (not just binaries)

**Key Learning Discovery:**
User realised they can write C++ code, compile to assembly, and reverse engineer their own code to learn patterns. This creates a powerful learning loop: **write C++ → compile to assembly → analyse with RE skills → understand patterns → recognise in production software**.

**Mental Model Shift Required (Pointers):**
User has years of high-level programming experience where array indexing feels like "pointing to a value." The low-level reality is the opposite: `scores[2]` is actually *dereferencing* — the bracket notation is syntactic sugar for `*(scores + 2)`. This requires active reinforcement through varied exercises to replace the ingrained high-level mental model.

### 3. Windows Internals & DLL Development - UPCOMING
**Goal:** Learn transferable skills for modifying any Windows application.

- [ ] Pointers and memory management (heap vs stack, allocation)
- [ ] Structs and custom data structures
- [ ] File I/O (reading/writing files programmatically)
- [ ] Building DLLs (shared libraries)
- [ ] Understanding process memory layout
- [ ] DLL injection techniques (CreateRemoteThread, AppInit_DLLs, etc.)
- [ ] Windows API basics (kernel32, user32 functions)
- [ ] PE file format understanding

### 4. Game RE Fundamentals - UPCOMING
**Goal:** Learn universal game modding techniques (using UT99 as practice target).

**Practice Target:** Unreal Tournament 99
- Chosen because: Large modding community, well-documented, simple by modern standards, no anti-tamper
- Purpose: Safe environment to learn techniques that transfer to any game
- Not the end goal, just a training dummy

**Transferable Skills to Learn:**
- [ ] Finding game state in memory (Cheat Engine techniques)
- [ ] Identifying function signatures and patterns
- [ ] Tracing execution flows without source code
- [ ] Understanding game loops and update cycles
- [ ] Function hooking (detours, trampolines)
- [ ] Memory patching techniques
- [ ] Finding strings → UI code → game logic
- [ ] Save file format analysis
- [ ] Instrumentation without crashing the application

### 5. Building the This Means Warp Mod - FUTURE

**Note:** This is the current ultimate goal, but may change as learning progresses and interests evolve. Skills learned are transferable to any game modding project.

**Specific Questions to Answer:**
1. How does the save system work?
2. Can saves be copied/moved?
3. Is it seeded or encrypted?
4. When can saves occur? (checkpoints only, or can we add quicksave?)

## Teaching Methodology

### Core Principles
1. **Ask, don't tell** - Lead with questions so user discovers concepts themselves
2. **One concept at a time** - Don't overwhelm with information
3. **Verify before advancing** - Ask "What do you think that does?" before explaining
4. **British English** - Colour, realise, whilst, etc.
5. **No hand-holding** - User requested critical, honest feedback
6. **Test previous knowledge** - Start sessions by asking about last session's concepts

### Code Writing Approach
1. **User writes first** - Let them attempt before showing solutions
2. **Compile and observe** - See actual results, not just theory
3. **Assembly analysis** - Use their RE skills to understand what the compiler generates
4. **Iterate** - Build upon working code, don't start from scratch

### Session Structure
1. **Review** - Quick questions on previous session (from PROGRESS.md)
2. **Current topic** - One new concept with practical coding
3. **Verification** - User explains back what they learned
4. **Document** - Update PROGRESS.md with what was covered

## Bash Shortcuts (User's WSL Environment)

These shortcuts exist in `~/.bashrc`:

**compile-asm:** Compiles C++ to both executable and Intel-syntax assembly
```bash
compile-asm() {
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "Usage: compile-asm filename.cpp"
        return 1
    fi
    local basename="${1%.cpp}"
    g++ "$1" -o "$basename" && g++ -S -masm=intel "$1" -o "${basename}.s"
    echo "Created: $basename (executable) and ${basename}.s (assembly)"
}
```

**gitpush:** Stages, commits, and pushes to main in one command
```bash
gitpush() {
    if [ -z "$1" ]; then
        echo "Usage: gitpush \"commit message\""
        return 1
    fi
    git add -A && git commit -m "$1" && git push origin main
}
```

## Before Starting Any Session

1. **Read PROGRESS.md** - See exactly where we left off and what to test
2. **Check for uploaded files** - User may provide current code state
3. **Ask review questions** - Test retention from last session (questions listed in PROGRESS.md)
4. **Focus:** User needs to learn C/C++ development, not reverse engineering
5. Check current branch: `git branch`
6. Check for uncommitted changes: `git status`
7. **Test previous knowledge** - Ask 1-2 questions about the last session's concepts before starting new material (PROGRESS.md has suggested questions)
8. Follow the teaching methodology above

## Knowledge Testing Examples

**Git questions:**
- "What branch should we create this feature from?"
- "What will `git status` show us right now?"
- "Why do we merge to develop before main?"
- "What's the difference between `git add` and `git commit`?"

**C/C++ questions:**
- "What's the difference between `=` and `==`?" (assignment vs comparison)
- "What's the difference between `<<` and `>>`?" (output vs input direction)
- "Which registers are used for the first two integer parameters in x86-64?" (EDI, ESI)
- "Where does a function's return value go?" (EAX/RAX)
- "Why do we need calling conventions?" (interoperability between compiled code)
- "What happens if `std::cin >>` fails when user enters invalid input?" (fail state, variable uninitialized)
- "Should compiled binaries be committed to git?" (no - only source code)
- "What's the difference between `while` and `do-while`?" (when condition is checked)
- "When would you use a `for` loop vs a `while` loop?" (counting/iteration vs conditional repetition)
- "What does `i++` do?" (increment i by 1, same as i = i + 1)
- "What's the difference between `i+=2` and `i=+2`?" (add 2 to i vs assign positive 2 to i)
- "How do you fix an infinite loop caused by `std::cin` failure?" (clear(), ignore(), then try again)
- "What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?" (exit loop vs skip to next iteration)
- "What's the difference between compiling and linking?" (upcoming)
- "What's the difference between the stack and the heap?" (upcoming)

**Array questions:**
- "Why are arrays zero-indexed?"
- "What happens if you access `array[10]` when the array size is 5?"
- "How do you iterate over an array with a for loop?"
- "How do you get the size of an array?" (`sizeof(array) / sizeof(array[0])`)

**Pointer questions (ACTIVE - requires reinforcement):**
- "What does `&variable` give you?" (the memory address)
- "What does `*pointer` give you?" (the value at that address)
- "What's the difference between `int* ptr` and `*ptr`?" (declaration vs dereferencing)
- "What does `scores[2]` actually do under the hood?" (pointer arithmetic + dereference: `*(scores + 2)`)
- "Why does `scores + 1` add 4 bytes, not 1 byte?" (pointer arithmetic scales by `sizeof(type)`)
- "If `scores` is at address `0x1000`, what address is `scores + 2`?" (0x1008 for int array)
- "What are `scores` and `&scores[0]}` — same or different?" (same — both are address of first element)
- "Is `scores[2]` a pointer or a value?" (a value — the bracket notation dereferences)
- "Rewrite `scores[3]` using pointer syntax." (`*(scores + 3)`)
- "Rewrite `*(ptr + 1)` using array syntax." (`ptr[1]`)

**Game RE questions (future):**
- "How would you find the save game code if you don't know where it is?"
- "What's the difference between analysing malware and analysing game logic?"
- "How can you hook a function without crashing the game?"

## Common Scenarios Encountered

**Divergent Branches:** When local and remote repositories have different commits
- Caused by: Editing files on GitHub whilst also making local changes
- Solution: `git pull origin main` to merge remote changes, then push
- Lesson: Always pull before pushing to avoid conflicts

**Multi-machine setup:**
- Need to create new Personal Access Token for each machine
- Configure `credential.helper store` to save authentication
- Set up `user.name` and `user.email` globally

**Compiled outputs in git:**
- Common beginner mistake: committing compiled binaries, assembly files, and object files
- Only source code (`.cpp`, `.h`) should be in version control
- Compiled outputs (executables, `.o`, `.s` files) should be in `.gitignore`
- Build artifacts can always be regenerated from source
- Use `git rm` to remove mistakenly committed binaries, then add patterns to `.gitignore`

## Important Notes

- **Language choice:** C/C++ (matches target games, user preference over Rust for now)
- **Target game:** This Means Warp (save system modification)
- **User strength:** Reverse engineering, binary analysis, understanding code
- **User gap:** Writing code, building tools, C/C++ development
- **Teaching style:** Critical, honest, no hand-holding - user explicitly requested this
- **British English:** Always use British spelling and conventions

## Next Session Goals

**Immediate next steps:**
1. **Pointer arithmetic practice** - Iterate through array using pointer instead of index
2. **Reinforce mental model** - More exercises showing `array[i]` ↔ `*(array + i)` equivalence
3. **Modify values through pointers** - Show that `*ptr = 100` changes the original variable
4. **Different data types** - char, float, string, bool (can introduce alongside pointers)

**Current progress:**
- Completed pointer fundamentals (address-of, dereference, declaration)
- Proved array/pointer equivalence (`scores` == `&scores[0]`)
- Proved indexing is pointer arithmetic (`scores[2]` == `*(scores + 2)`)
- Observed address spacing (4 bytes per int)
- **Identified mental model gap** - User thinks in high-level "pointing to value" terms, needs to internalise low-level "dereference" reality

**Why reinforcement matters:**
- Years of high-level programming create strong mental models
- Low-level pointer reality is counterintuitive at first
- Repeated varied exercises build new neural pathways
- Essential foundation for memory manipulation in game modding

**Upcoming tasks (transferable skills focus):**
1. Pointer arithmetic iteration (current)
2. Modifying values through pointers
3. Structs and custom data structures
4. Build simple file I/O tool (reads/writes files - applicable to save file analysis)
5. Create first DLL (transferable to any Windows application)
6. Practice on UT99 (safe environment to apply skills)
7. Eventually: Apply everything to This Means Warp (or whatever game interests you by then)

---

**Remember:** User is transitioning from "reading assembly" to "writing C++". Focus on development skills, not analysis skills.
