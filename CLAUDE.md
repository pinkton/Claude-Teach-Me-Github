# Claude Context File

## Project: AI-User-Training

## IMPORTANT: Language Preference
**Please use British English in all responses:**
- British spelling (colour, organisation, realise, whilst, etc.)
- British terminology and conventions
- Metric units where applicable

## Public Repository Notice
This repository is **publicly accessible** on GitHub at: https://github.com/pinkton/Claude-Teach-Me-Github
- Do not include sensitive information
- User is learning and documenting the process publicly
- AI-generated files are prefixed with `AI-*` to distinguish from user-created work

## Project Purpose
This is a **learning repository** for understanding git workflow and programming fundamentals.

The user (pinkton) is learning:
- Proper git branch workflow (main → develop → feature branches)
- Programming basics
- Eventually: Creating game modding tools for legacy games with limited modern support

## Current State
- [x] Repository initialised with proper branch structure
- [x] Completed git workflow tutorial with practical exercises
- [x] Successfully connected to GitHub with credential storage
- [x] Created practice Python scripts (hello.py, goodbye.py)
- [ ] Ready to begin programming fundamentals
- [ ] Not yet started actual game modding project

## Branch Strategy
- **main**: Production-ready, stable code only (never push broken code here)
- **develop**: Integration branch for testing features before production
- **feature/[name]**: Individual feature branches for isolated development

## Completed Work
- [x] Set up git repository
- [x] Configure git identity (username: pinkton, GitHub private email)
- [x] Complete git workflow tutorial
- [x] Create feature/helloworld branch with hello.py
- [x] Create feature/goodbye branch with goodbye.py
- [x] Successfully merge features through develop to main
- [x] Push all branches to GitHub
- [x] Set up credential storage for GitHub authentication
- [ ] Begin programming fundamentals
- [ ] Start game modding toolkit project

## Git Workflow Mastered
The user has successfully completed the full professional workflow:
```
feature/name → develop → main
   (work)      (test)  (production)
```

Key commands learned:
- `git checkout -b feature/name` - Create feature branch
- `git add`, `git commit -m "message"` - Save changes
- `git merge feature/name` - Integrate features
- `git push -u origin branch` - Upload to GitHub

## Notes for Future Sessions
When continuing this project, check:
1. Current branch with `git branch`
2. Uncommitted changes with `git status`
3. This file for context on what we're working on
4. The user prefers to execute commands themselves for learning (guide, don't do)
5. Always ask questions to reinforce understanding
