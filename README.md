# AI-User-Training

This repository is for learning proper git workflow and programming fundamentals.

## Goals
- Master git branching workflow
- Learn programming basics
- Eventually build game modding tools for legacy games

## Getting Started
This is a practice environment. Experiments and learning happen here!

## Workflow
We follow a structured git workflow:
- `main` branch: stable, production-ready code
- `develop` branch: testing and integration
- `feature/*` branches: individual features and experiments

## Commands used
Git Basics:
 - git init - Initialise repository
 - git add - Stage files
 - git commit -m "message" - Save checkpoint
 - git status - Check current state
 - git log - View history

Branching Workflow:
 - git branch - List branches
 - git checkout -b name - Create and switch to branch
 - git checkout name - Switch branches
 - git merge branch - Combine branches

Remote (GitHub):
 - git remote add origin URL - Connect to GitHub
 - git push -u origin branch - Upload to GitHub
 - git pull origin branch - Download and merge changes from GitHub

Handling Divergent Branches:
 - git config pull.rebase false - Configure pull to use merge strategy
 - git pull - Fetch and merge remote changes before pushing
 - Scenario: Local and remote have different commits that need combining

Authentication:
 - Set up Personal Access Token for password authentication
 - git config --global credential.helper store - Save credentials locally

## Abuse
This relies on the usage of Claude Code to tell me actions/commands and help me learn and develop. 
Any files that are uploaded typically the work of AI, is to highlight with a prepended 'AI-' to help delineate between my work and Claude created work. 
Please reach out to me for any disputes, I'm learning!
